During this project, I have tackled the The Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Bazreal where I have deployed my CV to the cloud using AWS as a public cloud provider and understanding several basic concepts of networking and server administration.

For the implementation, I have opted for the below architecture:

During this project, I have learned:
- How to deploy a fully functional and cost-effecetive cloud architecture using several AWS services such as EC2, S3, Cloudfront, etc..
- Understood the basics of networking for a web server and configured the necessary DNS records and certificates for my domain.
- Utilized Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, through Terraform, to define and manage the AWS resources, promoting reproducibility and scalability using modules and a managed S3 backend.
- Implemented a CI/CD Jenkins pipeline to automate the deployment process.
- Monitored the application using CloudWatch and AWS SNS topics to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the deployed application in the AWS cloud environment.
